		<description>
			<p>When the suppressing fire mode is attached to a gatling blaster, you can use your action to completely unload your charge pack into your enemies. Choose up to 6 enemies (or less depending on how many shots are left in your blaster) that are in front of you, not in cover, and within range, and make an attack roll against each of them. Each enemy hit has disadvantage on all their attack rolls on their next turn. Starting the turn after you use this feature roll a d6, on a 5 or 6 you regain this ability.</p>

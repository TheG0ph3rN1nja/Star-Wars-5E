    <description>
      <p>A pilot, sometimes called a flyboy, directly controlled the operation of a vehicle while located within the same craft. A pilot was often assisted by a copilot, navigator, astromech droid, weapons officer, or other crew members. The term "pilot" was applied across vehicles used on land or in water, air, and/or space.</p>
      <p class="indent">On smaller ships, the word pilot and captain were interchangeable, but on larger vessels, the pilots were rarely the commanders of the vessels.</p>
      <p class="indent">Starship captains, because of their generally piloting small-scale starships, were sometimes referred to informally as "flyboy."</p>

You can only use each Auxiliary Power system once, but you regain all expended uses upon finishing repairs while docked. In addition, once you have used Auxiliary Power, you must wait one round before you can use it again. When auxiliary power is shifted to a system, the following applies:</p>

The first time a hostile pilot encounters you they must make a DC 16 wisdom save. If they fail the save, they become feared for one minute. The hostile pilot can attempt to succeed on the save at the end of each of his or her turns.</p>

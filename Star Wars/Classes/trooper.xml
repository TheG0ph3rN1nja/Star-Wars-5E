			<p>Starting at 15th level, you have learned how to mod your weapons to stretch their charge packs to their maximum potential. The number of shots you can make with a blaster before reloading is multiplied by 1.5 (so gatling blaster becomes 18 shots, flamethrower has 12 shots, sniper has 9 shot, etc). Except for the bowcaster which gets x2 (so 4 shots). This counts towards your weapon mod limit and cannot be given to allies. When you acquire this ability at your DMâ€™s discretion you might find 1 for free.</p>

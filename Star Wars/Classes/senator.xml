Guardians are proficient in all simple and martial weapons and light and medium armor. You may add your Proficiency bonus to their attacks, damage rolls, and saving throws so long as you are within 120 feet of your cohorts and they are aware of your presence. If your cohort ever dies, another takes its place within one month's time, so long as you properly inform your governing body. While they may collect a salary or they are sworn to serve you and/or your governing body, any expenses they require are handled by your government. If you have been disavowed by your governing body or they have been destroyed, you must handle this matter on your own, depending upon the disposition of your cohorts.</p>
			<p class="indent">Cohorts take their turn on your initiative, though they don't take an action unless you command them to. On your turn, you can verbally command them where to move (no action required by you).

      <p>As an engineer, you need schematics to make your gadgets and know how they operate. These schematics are separated into 4 levels, with 1 being the most simple and 4 being extremely complicated. Each gadget costs a number of credits equal to the materials needed, and a certain amount of time.</p>
      <p class="indent">As an engineer, you automatically know 3 level 1 schematics and 2 level 2 schematics. Whenever you level up you can choose to replace one schematic you know with another schematic from the list. The new schematic must have an equal level to the schematic you replaced.</p>

			<p>At 20th level, you have completely learned the complex systems that are droids, and can even take over their systems. When you successfully hack a droid, you can temporarily make them attack their allies for up to 1 hour. Whenever it is that droid’s turn, you determine its movement and action, and it attacks whoever you designate as long as they are controlled. Once you use this ability, you cannot use it again until you have completed a long rest.</p>

			<p class="indent"><strong><i>Demoralize.</i></strong>As an action, you can demoralize the opposition. Choose a number of hostile creatures that you can see, and can see or hear you, up to your Charisma modifier (with a minimum of 1). Those creatures make a Charisma saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma Modifier). On a failed save, the creatures have a -1 penalty to attacks and saving throws. This lasts for 1 minute or until you use this feature again. A creature automatically succeeds on the saving throw if it is immune to being frightened. On a successful save, a creature becomes immune to the effects of demoralize for 24 hours. The hostile creatures lose this penalty if you cannot see them and they cannot see or hear you, or if you become Incapacitated. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier, regaining any expended uses when you finish a long rest. This penalty increases to a -2 penalty at 7th level, and to a -3 penalty at 13th level.</p>

      <p>Both infamous and anonymous at the same time, Mercenaries are heirs to a professional legacy—an ancient brotherhood with a glorious history. Tracking elusive targets across multiple star systems requires expertise, especially when the targets can be prominent, powerful, and often prepared for confrontation. Thrill seekers from all walks of life set out to become bounty hunters, but only the most hard-boiled survive in this competitive and deadly business. </p>

			<p>As a mercenary doing jobs all over the galaxy, you slowly but surely start to gain reputation and your name is known all around. From level 1 onwards, you gain a bonus to Intimidation and Persuasion checks equal to 1/4 of your level rounded normally.</p>
      <p class="indent">Rounding normally means basic mathematics rules. For instance, for a character of level 5, when its level is divided by 4, the result is 1.25. That would round down to one. For a character of level 6, however, when divided by 4, the result would be 1.5, which would round up to 2.</p>

If you take damage that would lower your hit points to 0, you can delay that damage and immediately take a bonus turn, interrupting the current one. You do not take the damage until the turn ends. It is possible to do things, such as gain resistances, that change how much damage you would take. Once you have used this feature, you cannot use it again until you complete a long rest.</p>

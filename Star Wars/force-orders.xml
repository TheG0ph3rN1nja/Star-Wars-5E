      <p>The Order of the Gray uses the force to its absolute limits. Followers of this order are known as Grays. They use force energy to modify their bodies, strengthening them against attack and turning themselves into living weapons.</p>
      <p class="indent">Their mastery of the force form grants them their name, for Grays are the balance between light and dark.</p>

      <h4>Jedi</h4>
      <p>Force wielders of the Order of the Jedi delve into the world of emotion, mastering their inner life to such an extent that they can manipulate and amplify the emotions of others with the same ease that an artist shapes clay. Known as Avatars, these mystics vary from tyrants to inspiring leaders who are loved by their followers.</p>
      <p class="indent">Jedi can bring out extreme emotions in the people around them. For their allies, they can lend hope, ferocity, and courage, transforming a fighting band into a deadly, unified force. For their enemies, they bring fear, disgust, and trepidation that can make even the most hardened veteran act like a shaky rookie.</p>

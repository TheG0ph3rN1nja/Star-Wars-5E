			<p>The Nautolans, sometimes referred to as the Nautiloids, were an amphibious humanoid species from the planet Glee Anselm. Although they established settlements across their aquatic homeworld, most Nautolan civilization was found in the Sabilon region. The most well known Nautolan was Jedi Master Kit Fisto, a hero of the Clone Wars and member of the Jedi Council.</p>
      <h4>Divided</h4>
      <p>Nautolans possessed physiology common to amphibious species, including low light vision and excellent swimming skills. Their bony exoskeleton and dense cartilage made them tough and resistant to glancing blows.</p>
      <p class="indent">An egg-laying species, Nautolans emerged from their egg as a tadpole that developed arms, legs, and head-tails during their second year of life. Roughly the same size as a Human infant during this time, their limbs were weak and unable to support their weight, forcing youthful Nautolans to remain in aquatic environments for much of their childhood. They stood an average of 1.8 meters, had smooth green, blue, purple, or brown skin, and large black or dark maroon eyes with lids that were seldom used. They were capable of breathing underwater; however, unlike other water-based species, Nautolans did not experience difficulties out of water.</p>

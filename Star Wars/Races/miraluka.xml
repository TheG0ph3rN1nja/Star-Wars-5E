		<description>
			<p>The Miraluka were a Near-Human species that differed from Humans in that they lacked eyes, only retaining vestigial eye sockets, and perceived the environment around them through Force sight instead of regular vision. This vision was so strong that if a Miraluka looked upon a Jedi or Sith, they could "see" Force radiating off them. The strength of a Miraluka's connection to the Force varied by individual.</p>
      <p class="indent">Miraluka, as Near-Humans, could interbreed with baseline humanity. Humans with Miraluka blood included Krynda and Lucien Draay. It was said that such mating would result in difficulties for the offspring.</p>
			<h4>Miraluka Traits</h4>

      <p class="indent"><strong><i>Telepathy.</i></strong> Miraluka can use their connection to the force to speak telepathically to any willing creature they can see with their force sight.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><i>Languages.</i></strong> Basic, Miralukese.</p>

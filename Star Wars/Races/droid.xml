			<p>Droids, short for androids, were mechanical beings, often possessing artificial intelligence. They were used in a variety of roles and environments, often those considered too menial or too dangerous for humans and other species. Droids were also used in fields that required extensive specialization and knowledge, such as medical droids and astromech droids. Droids designed for combat were battle droids.</p>
      <h4>Smart or too smart?</h4>
      <p>Depending on the model and its corresponding purpose, droids were totally obedient, rugged, expendable, capable of vast memory recall, and mathematically precise. These characteristics made them well suited for many jobs, though the lack of independent thought in the cheaper, less advanced models limited their capability. This lack of autonomy was simultaneously a vast asset and a glaring weakness—an asset in terms of obedience and control but a massive drawback in terms of effectiveness. Designers faced a fundamental paradox—make the droids overly intelligent, and they might rebel; yet make the droids not intelligent enough and they would be ineffectual.</p>
      <h4>Droid Names</h4>
      <p class="indent"><strong><i>Droid Names:</i></strong> 4-L0M, C-3PO, HK-47, IG-88, R2-D2</p>
			<h4>Droid Traits</h4>
			<p>Your Droid character has many different attributes that might be useful in the field:</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><i>Ability Score Increase.</i></strong> Your Intelligence score increases by 2.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><i>Machine Heart.</i></strong> You are a man-made construct. You are immune to disease. You do not need to eat or breathe. Instead of sleeping, you enter an inactive state for 4 hours each day. You do not dream in this state; you are fully aware of your surroundings and notice approaching enemies and other events as normal.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><i>Size.</i></strong> The player character droids are all around human size, but of course weighing between three to four-hundred pounds. Your size is Medium.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><i>Subrace.</i></strong> There are many different types of droids, the following of which a player can use as their character. There are other droids which can be used as familiars, which will be detailed later.</p>

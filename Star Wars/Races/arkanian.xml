		<description>
			<p>Arkanians considered themselves the pinnacle of evolution, and as such many were distinctly arrogant. Arkanian scientists had been experts in genetic manipulation for millennia, and by the time of the Mandalorian Wars the species had been split into many sub-species, making it hard to determine exactly what a baseline Arkanian was. Most could pass for Human, though the most pure of blood had pure white eyes and four clawed digits on each hand.</p>
			<p class="indent">Arkanians were capable of seeing into the infrared spectrum, and their eyes were sensitive to sources of extreme heat. This was helpful on their dark and frigid homeworld, but when traveling offworld, many were forced to wear blinders on planets with hotter, younger suns. It was also not unusual for an Arkanian to enhance themselves with internal and/or external cybernetics. It was also standard practice for Arkanians to undergo genetic manipulation of their own bodies, enhancing themselves so as to be better than "lesser" species.</p>
      <h4>Arrogant and Proud</h4>
      <p>The most defining trait of the Arkanian species was their arrogance which stemmed from their belief that they were the pinnacle of evolution. This led to them often appearing arrogant and aloof to others as they saw themselves as being superior to all other species. Even those with a more moderate viewpoint tended to see themselves as being amongst the most intelligent beings in the galaxy. As such, they were highly confident of their abilities.</p>

        <h4>Pureblood Traits</h4>
        <p>The arkanians were native to the Colonies planet, Arkania, a world of frozen tundra and intense cold. The rich gem mines on their planet led to its great development and the construction of elaborate trade cities established by offworlders from the Galactic Republic. This influx of commerce allowed Arkanian culture to flourish and the species quickly became well known throughout the galaxy for their extremely reclusive scientists.</p>

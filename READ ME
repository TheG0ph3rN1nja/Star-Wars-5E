READ ME!!!!
This will explain if there are changes to certain parts of the overhaul. If I miss something or there are question feel free to ask or comment.
Note: I DID NOT make any of this. All of this info came from https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-L3EDylnKWyz1lGQb5o9 ALTHOUGH I did change a few things
so it could work with Aurora or so it could make sense.

Races
-Mandalorian background changed to Race with subraces to make more sense

Backgrounds

Classes
-Senator class will only display the Guardian Companion as Aurora only supports 1 companion in the sheet generation as far as I know.

Items
-Some items still need to be added.

Other
-Repair and Security Skills are under Class Feature section and WILL ONLY show up if you select a SW5E Class
-There was no multiclass info added so it was not made available
-Strongly recommend turning off other sources unless you specifically want to use something for this campaign setting

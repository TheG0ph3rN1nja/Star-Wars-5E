READ ME!!!!
This will explain if there are changes to certain parts of the overhaul. If I miss something or there are question feel free to ask or comment.
Note: I DID NOT make any of this. All of this info came from https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-L3EDylnKWyz1lGQb5o9 ALTHOUGH I did change a few things
so it could work with Aurora or so it could make sense. I will try to keep this READ Me updated as much as possible.

Races
-Mandalorian background changed to Race with subraces to make more sense
-Humans are the same as Core so not added.(May add later)

Backgrounds

Classes
-Senator class will only display the Guardian Companion as Aurora only supports 1 companion in the sheet generation as far as I know.
-Force welding classes will have to select their class again for each force discipline so that it shows up on spellcasting sheet correctly.
-Engineer gadget creation are spells and is setup like the paladin class.( They will be added as purchasable items later as well)

Items
-Some items still need to be added.
-Gadgets are only creation spells right now
-Starship weapons and add-ons
-Weapon mods that are available for every class.(The tactician and Trooper are class features that you choose as you level up)

Other
-Repair and Security Skills are under Class Feature section and WILL ONLY show up if you select a SW5E Class
-There was no multiclass info added so it was not made available
-Strongly recommend turning off other sources unless you specifically want to use something for this campaign setting.
-If you are not a force welding class and gain access to a force discipline. Use THAT discipline's type for spellcasting.
-Demolitionist skill was not added because there were tools already available and only 1 class used it.
